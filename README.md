# Hyper-dimension Jump
A game created as a contender in the Ostravsky Game Jam 2025.

## Theme
- "Přes hranice", Over the border/edge

## Team behind it all:
**Short While Games** (we joined the Game Jam 5 minutes after 12 - on the 20th of October, hence the name)
- Adam El Saban - main and only programmer, most of the ideas behind this game came from him
- Richard Dluhoš - 3D artist
- Stanislav Janča - 3D artist
- Nela Březinová - 2D artist
- Mariana Bartečková - 2D artist

We're a team of mostly university students passionate about game development, some of us are repeating contenders from last year.

## Main idea
- You're located in another reality (hence the player look - tornado instead of legs, no joints)
- You're trying to escape by completing all portal break runs (orb race thingies) - in addition to the previous point is how we understood the main theme
- PS2-like, simple, low poly graphics - compensates a bit for using Unreal Engine 5

## Modes
**Normal** & **Hyper** - switch with the *Tab* key

### Normal mode
- Basic moving purposes

### Hyper mode:
- Actual "game" part

**Hyper mode controls:**
- *Moving mouse* in the X axis -> Moves player in the corresponding direction in hyper mode similarly to a steering wheel in a car
- *Spacebar* - in entry zone -> Starts portal break run (can be held before entering)
- *Left* xor *Right mouse button* - in interaction zone (rotating rings) -> High speed rotation with player instead of wheel like normally
- *Left **and** right mouse buttons* - in interact point (glowing orb) -> Trigger interaction point impulse to player aka boost (not throw, keeps momentum + impulse) in the same direction

Our programmer is going to continue development of this game.
